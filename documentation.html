        What is Strokes?</h4>
        <br>
        <p> 
          Strokes is a video gesture player, where a user can manipulate a video by drawing gestures rather than pressing buttons. 
        </p>
        <br>

        <h4>How to use Strokes:</h4>
        <br>
        <p>
          Strokes is a very simplistic video player. The possible gestures a user can perform are displayed at the top. The user can click on the sides in order to "slide" the carousel around and see more gestures. 
        </p>
        <center><a href="#"><img src="img/carousel.png" width="90%" height="50" position="center"></a></center>
        <p>The video is displayed on the left of the screen while the translucent canvas is right below the yellow bar on the right side of the screen.</p>
        <center><a href="#"><img src="img/fullScreen.png" width="90%"></a></center>
        <p>When a gesture is recognized, the top yellow bar will display the name of the gesture that was recognized and the video should respond immediately. <b>Please note that all gestures are <i>ONE STROKE</i> gestures!</b><p>
          <center><a href="#"><img src="img/canvasView.png" width="50%"></a></center>
          <br>
          <h4>So now what?</h4>
          <p>ENJOY! Go watch one of the best acapella mash-ups in recent history and play around with it!</p>

    <h3>The Design Process: A General Approach</h3>
    <p>I approached this homework by doing some basic research with the background information provided before delving into the design process, which included trying to come up with a hollistic view of what the application should do and how it would be used. </p>

    <h3>Research</h3>
    <p>I originally was planning on implementing this assignment in $P. After reading the article <i>Gestures as Point Clouds: A $P Recognizer for User Interface Prototypes</i>, it seemed natural to me to give users the option to be able to do multistroke gestures as well as unistroke, especially since $P has such a high level of accuracy, as can be seen by the following table:</p>
    <center><a href="img/gestureRecognizers.png"><img src="img/gestureRecognizers.png" width="40%"></a></center><br>
    <p>As is seen in the table above, $P has a very high accuracy rate for multi-stroke gestures and is therefore comparable to $1 because you are able to obtain a high rate of accuracy for uni and multi-stroke gestures.</p>
    <p>However, I realized that my although my logic was technically correct, for a simple video player, a user really does not need anything more than simple unistroke gestures to be able to interact with the video, eventually leading me to implement the project in $1 rather than $P.</p>

    <br><br>
    <h3>Use Cases and Scenarios: The Pre-Design Process</h3>
    <h4>Personas</h4>
    <p>Jane is an 18 year old college student. She is an avid gamer and spends long nights avoiding homework with Youtube marathons. She is plans on either majoring in mathematics or computer sciecne and feels very comfortable with computers and multimedia applications. </p>
    <p>Peter is a graduate student studying English with a focus on Narration. Peter avoids spending too much time on computers for things other than school but enjoys the occasional Buzzfeed binge or Netflix indulgence of Orange is the New Black. Although he is not an avid computer user, he is comfortable enough to find his way to Google Chrome and type in his favorite websites into the search bar. </p>
    <p>Pat has been an editor at The New Yorker for almost half a century. A fan of new media, even if it takes him a few years to fully grasp it, Pat is attached to his iPad and Macbook air devices where he has learned--with the help of his younger coworkers--to play Youtube videos for every occasion. Pat likes exploring new forms of media with the help of his coworkers, including Netflix, Youtube, and of course the iPad edition of The New Yorker. Although able to do everything he needs to do on a computer, Pat still considers himself a novice in the area of computers and is hesitant to try anything with computers without his trusted coworkers by his side to guide him through it at first.</p> 
    <br><br>

    <h4>Use Cases: Imagining the Possibilities of the Application</h4>
    <p>Use Case 1:<br>
      Jane, an 18 year old college student returns home after a long day of studying, ready to just relax for the night. She crawls into bed, in her super comfy pajamas so that she can just fall asleep right after she watches all the vides she wants to, and opens her computer. Loading the application, she is able to scroll through different videos with the simple "swipe through videos" gesture and adjust the video size with the "increase size" gesture to fit her screen the exact way she does likes. When her roommates comes in an asks her a question, she is able to quickly draw the "mute" gesture, which mutes the gesture and converse happily with her and eventually she can also gesture "play/pause" if the conversation is going on for too long. All the basic video functionality one would expect from a basic video player is transformed into a simple gesture based application. Most importantly, the gestures are simple and easily repeatable, so that it is not a hassle to adjust screen size incremently (and even fun). After a long day of studying, she is able to mindlessly watch videos with ease, in a fun and innovative new way. 
    </p>
    <p>Use Case 2:<br>
      Bob is a video editor who loves to show people the brilliance of video manipulation. He always had a hard time finding a good way to show people different ways that videos on websites are programmed. Luckily, Bob found this application while trying to find a fun video player. After a party where the main activity happened to be playing with the application and giving each guest a turn at playing with the gestures to manipulate the video, Bob now uses the application to show the different video manipulations that come standard on the web. Today, Bob has a meeting with his mentee who has just started getting into video editing and is learning to put videos on the internet. Bob opens the application and shows Sophia, his mentee, the different gestures that can be used from the help screen. Then Bob starts playing the video with the "play" gesture and then begins to manipulate the video while the video is playing. First he mutes and unmutes the video with the "mute" gesture. Then he shows how to draw the faster and slower playback gestures to show how videos can be speeded up and slowed down. And then changes the size and volume with the increase and decrease size as well as increase and decrease volume gestures, allowing Jane to understand the way that video manipulation can occur, because after they play the gestures they can look at the source code to see how it happened. Making this a great application for more than just a fun video viewing, but can also be used as an educational tool. </p>

      <h3>Developing the Program: Sketching the Steps</h3>
      <h4>The Prototypes</h4>
      <p>
       <center><a href="img/prototype1.jpg"><img src="img/prototype1.jpg" width="40%"></a></center>
       <center><h6>Initial thoughts and initial sketch</h6></center>
     </p>
     <br>
     <p>
      <p>After the first initial sketch, I met with a small group of other UI students to discuss their opinons on how to approach the assignment. I came with my initial sketch that was a very simple idea of having a title, a video that you could draw on, a help button, and a footer. I wanted their inputs on the subject and to know if they thought I was heading in the right direction. As my friends pointed out during our discussion, it is important to be able to view the gestures easily. For the novice user, seeing the gestures is an important aspect of designing the interface. I realized that putting the gestures in the help button would make looking at the gestures quite difficult. So in my next interations and my final product, I decided to make the gestures very visible, and eventually I decided to put my gestures in a carousel at the top of the page. In this way, the novice user could easily refer to the gestures while the experienced user could simply scroll slightly down and "hide" the gestures carousel at the top. 
        <center><a href="img/prototype2.jpg"><img src="img/prototype2.jpg" width="40%"></a></center>
        <center><h6>Second and third possible designs</h6></center>
        
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        <center><a href="img/prototype3.jpg"><img src="img/prototype3.jpg" width="40%"></a></center>
        <center><h6>Sketches that were created once I started coding the website and getting a real sense of how the program should work -- such as a separate canvas entity that was not connected to the video screen and a navigation bar.</h6></center>
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        After playing with the program design for a while with sketches I went and started playing with bootstrap, html5, and javascript. After playing with the languages for a bit I realized that although it is a nice idea to have the canvas on the video so that someone can techincally draw on the video, there are some issues with that. The first is that you are interfering with viewing space. Although you are not taking their eyes off of the screen, which is good, you are distracting them by putting something completely different on the screen, making the screen seem too cluttered and awkward. Having a separate canvas is actually ideal. Not only is it easier to program (although there are still issues with writing to the canvas being a bit off at some points), it makes more sense for the user. The user can choose when to look at the canvas and when to look at the video. There is no need for a clutter of seeing both and not being able to focus properly. The video, which is the center of the video player, remains prime. This also allows for someone who is very familiar with the system to look at the canvas in a more peripheral sense and draw the gestures from memory by just knowing the somewhat basic space they are accepted in. 
      </p>
      <p>Overall, the basic concept did not change much. The design was always focused on the video and making sure that the experience allowed for the best video experience. Through every iteration, I believe that the video became more of a prime focus, even if at first just glancing at the screen it does not look like it. </p>

      <h4>The Gestures</h4>
      <p>The following images show the basic stages of creating gestures for the program. At first the gestures were ones that could also be implemented in $P but then moved onto those that could be implemented in in $1 because of design changes and better understanding of the needs of the program.</p>

  <h3>A Step by Step Guide</h3>
  <h4>A Basic overview of the main components</h4>
  <p>The program opens up on the initial page where the user can immediately start playing with the program. A simple gesture to the user that the main component is the video player and they should get their hands wet as soon as possible.</p><br>
  <h4>The Navigation Bar</h4>
  <p>
    <center><a href="img/navigation.png"><img src="img/navigation.png" width="40%"></a></center>
    <center><h6>The Navigation bar</h6></center>
    At the top of the screen there is a navigation bar with the options "Strokes", "Help", and "Documentation." They buttons are organized in this fashion because Strokes, the main page should come first as a reminder that the entire program is basically there. Help is next in order to allow the user to feel free to click on it for additional information. Documentation is last because it is not needed to run the program but is a fun extra for those wanting to understand the motivation and development process that went into creating the program. Clicking on "Strokes" will get the user back to the initial program page.<br><center><a href="img/basicScreen.png"><img src="img/basicScreen.png" width="40%"></a></center>
    <center><h6>The Main Program Screen (index.html)</h6></center><br> This is to make it as simple as possible. The home screen and the program screen are one in the same so are therefore labled as "Strokes," the programs name.
    <br> Clicking the "Help" button will open a pop-up of simple instructions on how to run the program with images. This pop-up appears  in both the intial webpage and the documentation page, allowing the user to have easy access to the help section. The help section also explains how to use simple functionalities of the program (such as when to click versus when to gesture).<br>
    <center><a href="img/userGuide.png"><img src="img/userGuide.png" width="40%"></a></center>
    <center><h6>This screenshot shows part of the "Help" pop up.</h6></center> <br>
    Finally, clicking on "Documentation" leads to this page which outlines the process of creating the program and understanding the uses behind it.
    <br>The documentation page is included in the general program because it also allows the user to understand how each part was crafted and why certain aspects were created in a way -- for instance, why the canvas and the video are separate entities. 
    It, as you can see, explains the design processes, explanations of basic user interface design components and design decisions, as well as how to use the program. Basically giving a more in-depth look at the application from the programmer's perspective. 
    <center><a href="img/documentationPage.png"><img src="img/documentationPage.png" width="40%"></a></center>
    <center><h6>A section of the Documentation page. </h6></center><br>

    Overall, the navigation bar helps the user get to the items they need most: the initial webpage and the help pop-up menu. 
  </p>
  <br>
  <h4>The Gesture Carousel</h4>
  <p> The carousel of gestures at the top of the page is a helpful way for users to be able to scroll through all avaliable gestures for the video player. Clicking on either side of the carousel scrolls to the next page, allowing the user to easily see the gestures without any hassles of going to a new page or switching between a pop-up and the main screen. The gestures are there when needed, which is useful for experienced or novice users. Experts can simply scroll down slightly to hide the carousel and scroll up when they forget a specific gesture, while novice users can keep the carousel displayed at all times to make sure they are using the right gestures. The carousel also slides through the pages automatically, so users who are unaware that there are more gestures (even though there are clear instructions that you can scroll through the different pages in the user guide) will still be able to see all the different gestures. The idea of the carousel is to allow for a simple way to display information that is informative without being distracting, even though it is a consistent part of the page. <p>
    <center><a href="img/gesturesCarousel1.png"><img src="img/gesturesCarousel1.png" width="40%"></a></center>

    <center><a href="img/gesturesCarousel3.png"><img src="img/gesturesCarousel3.png" width="40%"></a></center>
    <center><h6>The third page of the gesture carousel. </h6></center>
    <br>

    <h4>The Video Player and the Canvas</h4>
    <center><a href="img/canvasAndVideo.png"><img src="img/canvasAndVideo.png" width="40%"></a></center>
    <center><h6>The two main components of the program: the video and the canvas on the right and left respectively. </h6></center>
    <p>
      The two main aspects of the program are the video where they video is played and the canvas where the gestures are drawn and recognized. The video is on the left-hand side of the screen. The canvas is on the right side of the screen but sometimes moves to the bottom right of the screen when the video player gets enlarged. 
    </p>
    <br>
    <h5>The Video </h5>
    <p>The video player is on the left hand side of the screen. The video does not have any controls on it, indicating to the user that they should use the alternate methods to do so, aka through the canvas. The video player is simplistic and basic. No added bells and whistles, just pure video with some added bonus through gestures. </p>
    <br>
    <h5>The Canvas</h5>
    The canvas is on the right hand side of the screen, though if the video is too big, the canvas will move to the bottom right-hand side. The canvas is the main way in which the user interacts with the video. There is not much to indicate that a canvas is a canvas in my program except for the yellow bar at the top that tells what gestures are being recognized. I realize that this is a somewhat flawed design, but I also think that generally people tend to associate things to squares, such that when they see a bar (and know from the instructions to draw underneath), the user will automatically draw within his own perceptions of where the square should be -- which is good enough for recognizing gestures. Also, the canvas will display the gestures (unless the video becomes to big and the canvas moves down, at which point there is a discrepancy between where the user draws the points and where they are shown on the screen). 
    <br>
    <h5>How to Use the Canvas to Manipulate the Video</h5>
    <p>The user can draw any of the single stroke gestures that are shown in the carousel at the top of the screen to manipulate the video. The user draws these gestures onto the canvas and the video should respond immediately, with the top yellow bar indicating which gesture was recognized for that particular time, giving users the ability to understand their enviornment better as well as getting insant feedback that is clear and precise, rather than having to guess what happened based on the video itself.<p>
      <p>The following are screenshots of gestures being recognized:</p>
